CI means new code changes to an app are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository.  


Continuous delivery usually means a developer’s changes to an application are automatically bug tested and uploaded to a repository (like GitHub or a container registry), where they can then be deployed to a live production environment by the operations team. 


Continuous deployment (the other possible “CD”) can refer to automatically releasing a developer’s changes from the repository to production, where it is usable by customers.



DevOps是Development和Operations的组合，是一种方法论，是一组过程、方法与系统的统称，用于促进应用开发、应用运维和质量保障（QA）部门之间的沟通、协作与整合。以期打破传统开发和运营之间的壁垒和鸿沟。
